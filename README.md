Tracking of CW bugs

This project is simply used as a placeholder to use the bugtracking features of Github instead of creating a wiki for tracking such things since it is much more appropriate to do in suxh a software.

contributing any files herr is subject to the included license. It is not planned to do so but may happen.

thanks for your time,


Red!
